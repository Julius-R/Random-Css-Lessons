				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I believe in values and working with a team. I strongly believe in the benefit of cooperating with others to learn and help one another grow. As far as the job, I bring to the table a drive for higher performance and a team oriented mindset that is willing to learn and respond to challenges for the sake of growth.</p>

				<h3>What I Offer</h3>
				<p>What I offer is timely and responsive website creation. I can create a website from scratch, or edit an existing design that you have. I can create single paged or multi-paged websites. I work remotely, and communicate through phone, email, Skype, or whatever service you find applicable and accommodating. Speed and pricing depends solely on what you want done. A single page product can take anywhere from a few hours to a days depending. Of course, larger products take longer.</p>
